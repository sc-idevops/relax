# Stefen’s Relaxation Toolkit

In these trying times, it's helpful to have things to fall back on to help you calm down.

## Meditate

- [Calm.com](https://www.calm.com) is an excellent service for meditations, music, and even bedtime stories to help you relax and… be calm. They have a daily calm meditation that is updated every day with a timely thought or theme, and many specialized meditations to help you meet your goals. Also available on [YouTube](https://www.viewtube.io/user/calmdotcom).
- [Bettersleep](http://bettersleep.com/): For those who have trouble sleeping, this website/app has completely custom soundscapes with individual sliders, bedtime stories, even relaxation routines called “Sleep Moves” to help you get better sleep. This is my absolute go-to of all my recommendations, I am particularly fond of their hypnosis tracks and cute stories. Also available on [YouTube](https://www.viewtube.io/user/utopiansounds).
- [Medito](https://meditofoundation.org/medito-app): Volunteer run ad free meditation app. A solid choice with no commitment required!
- [Deep Meditate](https://deepmeditate.com): Another stellar app with personalized meditation plans and bedtime stories to help you any time of the day. Available only on an app.
- [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com) is another good meditation app, and also available on YouTube.

### Yoga Nidra
The Yoga of sleep takes you through several practices to take you on a voyage through yourself to help you relax and fall asleep at night

## Listen

### Music/Sounds

- [myNoise.net](http://mynoise.net/) is a website filled with many sound generators which can help soothe you and transport you to different places with hundreds of custom top quality soundscapes.
- [Moodist](https://moodist.app/) a simple open source website where you can listen to relaxing sounds with minimal fuss!
- Another favorite is [Liquid Mind](https://www.viewtube.io/channel/UCgogqJdyUFxNWjdD69kyE5Q), an excellent series of albums of very slow relaxing music.
- [Atmosphere](https://peakpocketstudios.com) is a free app with a solid selection of sounds you can mix and match to suit your tastes.
- If you enjoy the calming lofi style of music, check out [Walking Dog](https://www.viewtube.io/c/WalkingDogMusic), a DMCA free record label available on Youtube (or wherever you prefer to get your music from)
- If you prefer something more open ended for your meditations the [Meditative Mind Youtube Channel](https://www.viewtube.io/c/TheMeditativeMind) has all kinds of nice background sounds.

### ASMR
- [Vito ASMR](https://viewtube.io/watch?v=NkKyY3eqll0?t=223&si=DozQfevujQsbso4X) a long variety compilation. I skipped the intro as it seemed a bit chaotic
- A Sound Bath is something soothing to listen to consisting of "singing bowls"
  - [Example of a sound bath on Youtube](https://www.viewtube.io/watch?v=-BlO514Iwvo)

### Stories

- [Pzziz](https://pzizz.com) is an excellent app of sleep stories, soft sounds and is set up for a full night’s sleep or if you just want to take a nap! See also their spinoff apps:
  - [Doze](https://dozeapp.com/) A spinoff of Pzziz with a different UI.
  - [Mesmerize](https://www.mesmerizeapp.com/) Another highly recommended app, it has many pre-sets so you can relax faster with less thinking. The visualizations are engaging and the hypnotism is very effective.
- [Loona](https://loona.app) is an excellent app that has special interactive sleep stories where you color in a scene while the story unfolds! They also have regular bedtime stories and music to enjoy as well. Also available on [YouTube](https://www.viewtube.io/channel/UCvOwxjPkjT8TdGrEP3IsxzA).
- Similar to Bettersleep, [Slumber](https://slumber.fm) has a huge library of bedtime stories and several relaxing sounds you can customize to help you drift to sleep.

### Podcasts

- The [Sleep with Me](https://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com) podcast is always available if you need someone to drone on until you fall asleep. Scoot's quirky personality and creaky voice will lull you to sleep.
- Similar to Sleep with Me, [Sleep Whispers](https://sleepwhispers.com) is a recorded session of ramblings in a quiet almost ASMR like tone designed to give you something to listen to while you drift off.

## Watch

### Hypnosis
- [A Visual Hypnosis Example](https://www.viewtube.io/watch?v=it5WX2gxXP4): Just stare at the colorful pattern while the minimal music and gentle suggestions help you relax.
- [Zen Garden Example](https://www.viewtube.io/watch?v=wxflcCxqebU): a wooden rake sliding through sand provides delightful ASMR like effect, and singing bowls are included.

### Pluto.tv 
Pluto TV has several excellent relaxing channels.
- My favorite is [Naturescape](https://pluto.tv/live-tv/naturescape): (it is unfortunate it can be interrupted by ADs but the view is nice for being free)
- There are other channels if you just need something mindless on to have in the background making noise. You’ll also find [Bob Ross](https://pluto.tv/en/live-tv/the-bob-ross-channel) there too!

### Twitch.tv
Twitch has several streams I find relaxing to watch.
- More often than not [Bob Ross](https://www.twitch.tv/bobross) is painting pictures with his almost ASMR like voice.
- Twitch also has [Cooking Shows](https://www.twitch.tv/hungry) running 24/7 which are surprisingly relaxing and 100% drama free.
- One of the more odd streams called [Nothing, Forever](https://www.twitch.tv/watchmeforever) is a seemingly AI generated sit-com in the style of Seinfeld which never seems to end...

### Youtube 
There are a variety of youtube channels which I've broken down into different categories to watch:

#### Restoration Videos
- [Odd Tinkering](https://www.viewtube.io/@OddTinkering): Electronics restoration with no sponsors or commentary. Just the sounds of repairwork.
- [Old Things Never Die](https://www.viewtube.io/@OldThingsNeverDie-): Another silent restoration channel. No nonsense, just the magic of watching something old become new again.
- [TysyTube](https://www.viewtube.io/@TysyTube): Restores various items, a good sense of humor in the text only commentary.
- [MountainRugCleaning](https://www.viewtube.io/@MountainRugCleaning): No commentary, just the sounds of carpets being scrubbed. Satisfying seeing something being cleaned.
- [Rescue Restore](https://www.viewtube.io/@RescueRestore)

#### Craftmaking
- [PearFleur](https://www.viewtube.io/@PearFleur)
  - [Making Paint: BLUE IRIS](https://www.viewtube.io/watch?v=aCKtkvFvXa8)
  - [Clay Crafting:](https://www.viewtube.io/watch?v=5CZMI__cL_A)
- [bitter melon bindery](https://www.viewtube.io/@bittermelonbindery)

#### Cooking
- [Emerald marine Chocolate mint tart](https://www.viewtube.io/watch?v=TXXjeIF7M7I)

As many times as I've mentioned Bob Ross there is new content in his style on the [Bob Ross Youtube Channel](https://www.viewtube.io/@bobross_thejoyofpainting) that are worth watching. 

## Do

- Breathe. Really, just pay attention to your breath. It’s the most basic of tools you have anywhere and anytime to help control anxiety. You’ll find this a recurring theme in nearly all of my other recommendations.
- Physical Basics: 
  - Have you eaten? 
  - Are you thirsty? Tea is super relaxing if you need to get some hydration in. 
  - Don't forget, have you slept?
- Writing down what’s on your mind can help dump out everything onto paper so you can come back to it later while focusing on relaxing in the here and now.
- Coloring something either digitally or on paper can be very diverting and make you feel like a kid again <3
- Talking with friends and loved ones can help you express what’s on your mind and together you can try to solve what’s bothering you.
- A warm bath or a shower can be relaxing. Consider adding scented candles or bath salts enhance the effect!
